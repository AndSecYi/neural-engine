# Reverse engineering the ANE

There is currently no public API for using the ANE, but there are private frameworks that are used by Core ML. It is possible to figure out how the ANE works -- or at least how to talk to it -- by looking inside these private frameworks.

geohot has published [some initial results](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/tree/master/ane) in the tinygrad repo.
